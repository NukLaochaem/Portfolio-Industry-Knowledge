                    <p>Community was our first semester project, force on design and HTML & CSS.</p>
                    <p>Goal was to focused on content management, SEO, mobile responsive, appeal of the website and ease
                        navigation and WCAG guidelines.
                    </p>
                    <p>The biggest problem i had with this project was responsive deisgn, start to code as website
                        before mobile was a mistake.</p>

                    <p>RainyDays is a project we been working across the first years of study, first half was about
                        Deisgn/prototype and HTML & CSS. Later on we learn to use javascript update the functionality at
                        the end of the year.
                    </p>
                    <p>We update the website due to a subject we were learing like interaction design,
                        javascript and WordPress.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p>The 1st year project exam we got was a blog website as task. The content for the website must be
                        store on WordPress. </p>
                    <p>Put in use what we have learn in the first year. we had around 1 month deadline to
                        make the website with prototype and a report feedback half way tho the project from users to
                        test the project with hotjar.</p>
                    <p>With the feedback i look at what the users spends most/less time at, does the navigation work the
                        way i wanted to. I use that infomation to update the project.</p>
